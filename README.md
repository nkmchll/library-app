# library-app

Built a book management app. Some features include adding a book and displaying it, this requires the user to enter information such as book title, author, number of pages, and if it has been read or not. The user can also remove the book from the library or change the status whether it has been read or not. The app currently displays 2 books but user can remove it from the library.
